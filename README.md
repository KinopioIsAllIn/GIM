# Gaussian-Based Instance-Adaptive Intensity Modeling for Point-Supervised Facial Expression Spotting

## Introduction

Official Pytorch Implementation of 'Gaussian-Based Instance-Adaptive Intensity Modeling for Point-Supervised Facial Expression Spotting' (ICLR2025)

Even though the SpotFormer has not been accepted yet, we decide to release the source code.
However, the current version has not been organized well, we will continue to organize it.

This is an improved version from the conference version.

## Acknowlegment
We implement our source code based on [CO2Net](https://github.com/harlanhong/MM2021-CO2-Net/tree/master).
